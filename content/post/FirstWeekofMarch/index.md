This week's study at RUDN University was quite fulfilling. In the C++ class, the teacher talked about object-oriented programming, especially inheritance and polymorphism. I wrote a small program for a bank account and felt that I had a deeper understanding of the code structure. In terms of Linux, I learned more command line operations, such as using grep and awk to process text. I also tried to write a few simple shell scripts to automate some repetitive tasks, which was quite convenient. However, pointer and memory management are still a bit of a headache, and it took some time to debug. Next week I plan to continue studying STL and learn Linux network configuration by the way. I hope it will become more and more convenient!
